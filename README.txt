This is a port of my Square Dance Definitions project, which has already 
been deployed on several other platforms, specificially Mac OS 9, web, 
and native Android (Eclipse/Java/ADT).

This port to jQuery Mobile, Javascript, and SVG should allow it to be
a nice experience on Android, iOS, and other mobile platforms. I intend
to compile it using PhoneGap, then compare the design and performance
of the cross-compiled version vs. the native Java/ADT version.

The base for this project is at http://www.mixed-up.com/
